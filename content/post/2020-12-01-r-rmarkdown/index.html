<div id="welcome-to-my-site" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Jayati</strong> (<em>rhymes with homogeneity</em>) and I’m a 2nd year ScM student in genetic epi.
I have done undergraduate research in genetics using various statistical methods, and am most comfortable coding in R (&amp; have been for the past 5ish years). I hope to learn more about making my work reproducible and how to take advantage of all the new and cool packages R offers, especially for dataviz!</p>

<h1>Something that interests me:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8oiwnNlyE4">Flatland</a>, an 1884 book by Edwin Abbott later adapted to a movie, is about shape-based characters in an increasingly complicated world. It’s really about multi-dimensionality and complex math, but in a fun and fictional way.</p>
