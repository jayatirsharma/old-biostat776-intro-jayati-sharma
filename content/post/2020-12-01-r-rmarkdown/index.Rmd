# Welcome to my site!
My name is **Jayati** (*rhymes with homogeneity*) and I'm a 2nd year ScM student in genetic epi. 
I have done undergraduate research in genetics using various statistical methods, and am most comfortable coding in R (& have been for the past 5ish years). I hope to learn more about making my work reproducible and how to take advantage of all the new and cool packages R offers, especially for dataviz!

# Five Fun Facts:

1. (I think) I've recently outgrown my avocado allergy! (Guac is so good.)
2. The most adventurous thing I've done is going whitewater rafting in Ecuador a few years ago.
3. I can listen to the same song on repeat for days.
4. I'm allergic to cats and dogs (*this is actually not very fun*).
5. I skipped the second grade. 


# Something that interests me:
[Flatland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8oiwnNlyE4), an 1884 book by Edwin Abbott later adapted to a movie, is about shape-based characters in an increasingly complicated world. It's really about multi-dimensionality and complex math, but in a fun and fictional way.
